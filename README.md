# deskas
an electron Google Assistant desktop app

requires your own google api credentials for a project with assitant api enabled.

requires grpc for electron ``npm install grpc --runtime=electron --target=<electron version>``

this was a weekend build, so it is unfinished and has very little error handling and lots of formatting issues.
